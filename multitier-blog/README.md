# multitier-shop

Overview
This readme file provides an overview of the multitier architecture used in this project. The multitier architecture is a software architectural pattern that divides an application into distinct layers or tiers, each responsible for a specific set of functionalities. This approach promotes separation of concerns, modularity, and scalability. The following sections will outline the different tiers and their roles in this architecture.

Tiers
Presentation Tier
The presentation tier, also known as the user interface (UI) tier, is responsible for presenting information to the users and receiving user inputs. It handles the interaction between the users and the application. This tier typically consists of web browsers, mobile applications, or desktop applications. The main goal of the presentation tier is to provide a user-friendly and intuitive interface.

Application Tier
The application tier, also known as the business logic tier or the middle tier, contains the application's business logic and processes the user's requests. It acts as a mediator between the presentation tier and the data tier. The application tier is responsible for validating user inputs, applying business rules, and orchestrating various operations. It encapsulates the core functionality of the application.

Data Tier
The data tier, also known as the persistence tier or the backend tier, is responsible for storing and retrieving data. It typically involves a database management system (DBMS) or other storage mechanisms. The data tier handles tasks such as data storage, data retrieval, and data manipulation. It provides a reliable and efficient way to persist and manage the application's data.

Usage
Once you have the project running, you can explore the different sections of the web page. The layout is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Feel free to modify the styles.css file to experiment with different styles and layouts.

You can also modify the content of the web page by editing the HTML structure in the index.html file. Customize the text, images, and other elements to fit your needs.
